# python_kaawash
Skiffle-friendly chordsheet generator, with simple markup

## Note to Phil: 
The "simple" part of this repo description is really fucking important. Let's not go overboard here ~~as the markup interpreter is already a bit of a pig in lipstick~~.

## How to use
* Song files should be placed in the 'songs' folder, in the format used in the examples.
We should really document the format at some point. Spaces are syntax, so be careful with that.

* Run main.py, and view index.html

## To-do:
* ~~Clean up the code because it's bad and I should feel bad.~~
* Add datestamps or songbook names to HTML files to avoid overwriting.
* Consider subfolders in 'songs' to generate multiple, distinct songbooks.
* Properly style the generated HTML, using proper CSS rather than inline.
