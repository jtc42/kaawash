# python_kaawash
Skiffle-friendly chordsheet generator, with simple markup

## Note to Phil: 
The "simple" part of this repo description is really important. Let's not go overboard here ~~as the markup interpreter is already a bit of a pig in lipstick~~.

## How to use
* To create a new songbook, make a folder in the 'books' folder, named after the book.
* Within that folder, create song text files in the format 'artist_song name.txt'
* Run main.py
* Book files, in all available template formats, will be created in the 'books' folder

## To-do:
* ~~Clean up the code because it's bad and I should feel bad.~~
* Add datestamps or songbook names to HTML files to avoid overwriting.
* ~~Consider subfolders in 'songs' to generate multiple, distinct songbooks.~~
* Properly style the generated HTML, using proper CSS rather than inline.
